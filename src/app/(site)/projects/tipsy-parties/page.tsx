            <div className="mt-8 space-y-6 text-mid-grey leading-relaxed">
              <p>Tipsy Parties was growing fast — but every new booking meant more manual work. Quoting was done by hand. Bartender allocation was a spreadsheet exercise. Stock was tracked on paper. Customer emails were answered between events. Recruitment was a constant, time-consuming cycle.</p>
              <p>The business was limited by the number of hours the founder could work. Growth meant more chaos, not more freedom.</p>
